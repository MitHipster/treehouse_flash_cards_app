# Flash Card App

Treehouse Express Basics Course

## Acknowledgments

Thanks goes to [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) for making this [Express Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics-2) course.

## Description

Re-created a Flash Card app using Express and middleware. Custom routes were defined using Express Router. The Treehouse course leverages Pug for it templating engine. However, I refactored it to use Handlebars instead. I also supplemented the routing logic to prevent app crashes from malformed URLs that the course did not have time to address.
